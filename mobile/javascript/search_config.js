If herniated, measure lying down after 5 – 10 minutes. If the measurement falls between sizes for 3˝ – 6˝ wide belts, go down a size. For 7 ˝+ wide belts, go up a size.\nBELT WIDTH\nFor pouch support, hernia prevention or a prolapsed stoma, a narrow belt (3˝ or 4˝ ) is usually suf cient. For hernia support, measure the hernia or area you want to support from bottom to top and round up to the next whole inch. Cover 75 – 80% of the hernia.\nHOLE OPENING SIZE\nDepends on the pouching system. The standard opening size is 23⁄8˝. For two-piece systems, typically add 1⁄2˝ to the  ange size. For one-piece pouches, adhesive couplings or other systems, measure where the pouch attaches to the wafer and add 1⁄4˝. Ring should be snug, but not pinching the sides of the pouch.\nHOLE PLACEMENT\nTo determine custom hole placement,  rst measure from the bottom of the hernia or where you’d like the belt to start, up to the bottom of where the pouch attaches to the wafer, or the bottom of the  ange. This will determine the distance between the bottom edge of the belt and the edge of the hole.\nBeige color add BG to item number, i.e. BG6594.\n176\n","NU-HOPE (79)\nNU-FORMTM SUPPORT BELTS\nComfortable binder that conforms to bulges and other body shapes more naturally.

Users can forget they are wearing a pouch they can wear regular clothing and virtually eliminate leakage. Designed for discreet appearance and to provide a  atter abdominal pro le. When the pouch is contained within the support, it provides a larger area across the lower abdomen for pouch contents to be evenly distributed, providing concealment. To conceal and prevent bulging/ballooning, it is recommended that a 9˝ or longer pouch be used, directing the pouch tail to the opposite side. The support provides security and peace of mind, and maintains an adhesive seal – extending wear time. It also creates a barrier between skin, pouch and wafer that helps prevent rashes and skin breakdown. User will not feel the pouch, heat or tail closure; pouch is rustle-free. Access for urinary night drainage tubing on all products.

Collagen is a biological platform for all new growth1 and supplies nutritive protein directly to the wound site2. Collagen promotes and accelerates cellular regeneration by replicating the natural  broconnective template3 and provides mechanical protection against physical and bacterial insult4. Interacts with the wound site as it forms a gel and creates a moist wound environment. Less painful; becomes a gelatinous\nmass as it comes in contact with exudate. No need to remove prior StimulenTM powder applications; readily broken down by the natural enzymes present in most wound  uids. Cost-effective; lower cost per dressing change (case studies have shown improved outcomes at less cost compared to the previous protocols and products on these same wounds). Use with a non-adherent secondary dressing and secure with tape or appropriate wrap. Conveniently available in packets for single use and bottles for continued use.
