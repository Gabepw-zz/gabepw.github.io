If herniated, measure lying down after 5 – 10 minutes. If the measurement falls between sizes for 3˝ – 6˝ wide belts, go down a size. For 7 ˝+ wide belts, go up a size.BELT WIDTHFor pouch support, hernia prevention or a prolapsed stoma, a narrow belt (3˝ or 4˝ ) is usually suf cient. For hernia support, measure the hernia or area you want to support from bottom to top and round up to the next whole inch. Cover 75 – 80% of the hernia.HOLE OPENING SIZEDepends on the pouching system. The standard opening size is 23⁄8˝. For two-piece systems, typically add 1⁄2˝ to the  ange size. For one-piece pouches, adhesive couplings or other systems, measure where the pouch attaches to the wafer and add 1⁄4˝. Ring should be snug, but not pinching the sides of the pouch.HOLE PLACEMENTTo determine custom hole placement,  rst measure from the bottom of the hernia or where you’d like the belt to start, up to the bottom of where the pouch attaches to the wafer, or the bottom of the  ange. This will determine the distance between the bottom edge of the belt and the edge of the hole.Beige color add BG to item number, i.e. BG6594.176]]></page><page Index="179" isMAC="true"><![CDATA[NU-HOPE (79)NU-FORMTM SUPPORT BELTSComfortable binder that conforms to bulges and other body shapes more naturally.

Users can forget they are wearing a pouch they can wear regular clothing and virtually eliminate leakage. Designed for discreet appearance and to provide a  atter abdominal pro le. When the pouch is contained within the support, it provides a larger area across the lower abdomen for pouch contents to be evenly distributed, providing concealment. To conceal and prevent bulging/ballooning, it is recommended that a 9˝ or longer pouch be used, directing the pouch tail to the opposite side. The support provides security and peace of mind, and maintains an adhesive seal – extending wear time. It also creates a barrier between skin, pouch and wafer that helps prevent rashes and skin breakdown. User will not feel the pouch, heat or tail closure; pouch is rustle-free. Access for urinary night drainage tubing on all products. Barrier/Support 100% cotton wicks/absorbs moisture away from skin.Note: When ordering, replace the A with the desired Barrier/Support Size (S-small, M-medium, L-large and XL-x-large), and replace B with the Stoma Location (R-right, L-left, C-center and D-dual).

As wound exudate is absorbed, the dressing forms a gel, which allows for non-traumatic removal. The dressing provides a cooling and soothing, hydrogel-like feel. Indicated for dry to moderately exuding wounds.Based solely on advanced super absorbent polymers. When  uid is absorbed in dressings, super absorbent polymer core converts to a gel, locking  uid inside dressing. Help prevent maceration, keeping harmful components within wound  uid away from wound. Can be used under compression. Dressings have a nonadherent wound cover, allowing for easy, pain-free removal. For use on wounds with moderate to heavy amounts of exudate.2.4˝ x 2.4˝4.33˝ x 4.33˝2.8˝ x 2.8˝ (4.3˝ x 4.3˝ with adhesive border) 4.5˝ x 4.5˝ (6˝ x 6˝ with adhesive border)ITEM #(DS)31622 (DS)31644 (DS)31722 (DS)31744HCPCSA4649 A4649 A4649 A4649SOLD BY10/bx 10/bx 10/bx 10/bx4˝ x 5˝ 6˝ x 9˝ITEM #(DE)89545 (DE)89569HCPCSA6252 A6253SOLD BY10/bx 10/bx310]]></page><page Index="313" isMAC="true"><![CDATA[0630807-1-EN]]></page><page Index="314" isMAC="true"><![CDATA[WOUND CARELATEX FREELATEX FREELATEX FREELATEX FREELATEX FREECONTAINS SILVERLATEX FREELATEX FREEDERMA SCIENCES (DE/DS/GL/KK)CATIONIC BIOCIDE IMPREGNATED DRESSINGSBIOGUARD® Barrier DressingsPatented line of infection control dressings with strong, broad-spectrum activity against wound pathogens, such as MRSA, VRE and pseudomonas.
